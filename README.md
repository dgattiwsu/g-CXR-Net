# g-CXR-Net: A graphic interface for CXR-Net

g-CXR-Net is a graphic interface to run CXR-Net two-module Artificial Intelligence pipeline for the quick detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Antero/Posterior (A/P) chest X-rays (CXRs). 

The repository contains two folders, Module_1 and Module_2, required to build a functional CXR-Net model.  

The GUI app, g_CXR_Net.py, can be launched from a virtual env with the command line syntax: python g_CXR_Net.py --xdir 'executable_dir', where 'executable_dir' is the directory where g_CXR_Net.py itself is located. Python scripts to generate icon links to run g-CXR-Net are in the directory CXR_Net_icons. The app can also be run outside a virtual environment, but in this case a full path to python location in the virtual env must be provided.  

A video describing the use of g-CXR-Net can be watched/downloaded at http://veloce.med.wayne.edu/~gatti/neural-networks/cxr-net.html.
